## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Java is installed on your system.
2. Compile and run the code:

```bash
javac calculator.java
java calculator
🧠 What I Learned
Taking input with Scanner

Using methods for modular code

Loops (while) and conditionals (switch)

Handling edge cases like division by zero

Building user-friendly CLI menus
